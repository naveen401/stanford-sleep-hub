        |To Nap or Not to Nap?:
      p Viewers and friends, a lot of people new to the sleep community have been talking and asking about naps and exactly what role they should play in someone’s sleep life. Does napping actually help rejuvenate the brain and refresh your body? Won’t napping just make you unable to sleep properly at night and hinder your ability to get a full night’s sleep? Well, to help illuminate the issues surrounding napping, I have decided to blog about the various pros and cons of napping and let you decide for yourself!

        |Pros:
      p Studies from the Mayo Clinic and Famed Stanford Professor and Sleep Researcher Dr. Dement have shown that napping does indeed offer various benefits such as relaxation, reduced fatigue, increased alertness, improved mood, and overall improved performance. These benefits stem from having a reduction in a concept called “sleep debt.” Sleep debt is essentially the amount of sleep deprivation someone has at any given moment. It occurs when you don’t get the amount of sleep your body optimally needs for a day. It is a quantitative figure that only grows with more sleep deprivation, and starts seriously affecting your mood and overall daily performance when it grows large. When sleep debt become too large, your ability to stay awake will be severely diminished and your body will essentially force you to sleep. Dr. Dement’s studies have shown that the ONLY way to reduce your sleep debt is to sleep! Coffee, Caffeine, etc. do not help the situation at all. Therefore napping, which is a form of sleeping, helps you reduce your sleep debt and therefore results in the benefits that come with having less sleep debt, such as quicker reaction times, better memory, fewer mistakes, and perhaps most importantly, FEWER ACCIDENTS! Remember, DROWSINESS IS RED ALERT!

        |Cons:
      p Although naps have many positive effects, they can also have drawbacks and unwanted side-effects. Napping too frequently or too long can lead to grogginess and disorientation after waking up. This sort of grogginess makes you think you are still tired and can result in you wanting to sleep even more! This phenomenon historically had been attributed to oversleeping, which is a myth. People used to think that if they overslept, then they would become more tired. Dr. Dement and other researchers have proven this false and developed a concept called “sleep inertia” which explains the grogginess after sleep. Sleep inertia refers to the subjective feeling of grogginess immediately following an abrupt awakening, and also refers to the tendency of a person wanting to return to sleep. Research by the Human Factors Division at NASA has shown that depth of sleep when awakened, timing of sleep and chemical influences are key factors that determine how severe the sleep inertia will be upon awakening and how long it will last. You may be confused after taking a nap and being groggy, but this is just normal! So I’d advise not taking a nap right before needing to do something important. Napping may also cause problems with sleeping at night. For most people, taking short naps won’t affect their ability to sleep and night and the quality of sleep they receive. However, there are circumstances in which napping can and will reduce nighttime sleep quality. For example, if someone is already fully caught up on their sleep and has NO sleep debt (kudos!), then taking a nap may make it harder to fall asleep during the night when everyone else is sleeping. Also, if someone already has prior sleep conditions such as insomnia (the inability to sleep), napping may worsen their insomnia symptoms during the nights. In addition, taking longer naps may also increase nighttime sleep problems regardless of whether or not you have any sleep.

        |The Ideal Nap:
      p So now that we’ve been over the pros and cons of sleeping, for those of you who decide that naps will provide more benefits than drawbacks, I’m here to help show you the characteristics of the “ideal nap”. The ideal nap is one that maximizes all of the pro effects and minimizes all the con effects. It’s a win-win situation! You should consider taking a nap if you are especially fatigued, are about to experience sleep loss due to some pressing need that you must stay awake for (ex: a work shift), or are about to make naps a routine behavior (which provides more benefits and stability than irregular napping!). Now, the ideal nap for these situations has several key features. The first one is to keep the naps short. The ideal nap time hovers around 10-15 minutes but can last up to 30 minutes. Having these seemingly quick naps allows you to still rest and reduce sleep debt while minimizing the amount of sleep inertia you have afterwards. Remember, the longer you nap, the more likely you will feel groggy and the longer you will experience sleep inertia. The second feature of an ideal nap is to take a nap is in the afternoon post-lunch. This is not because lunch makes you sleepy, but rather that our bodies’ natural circadian rhythm has us experience a drop in alertness levels around this time. Also, naps taken during the early afternoon are less likely to cause nighttime sleep issues. The third feature of an ideal nap is to create a calm, comfortable sleeping environment with few distractions. This will greatly increase the sleep quality of your nap! These three features will ensure maximum benefits and minimum drawbacks of naps, but there is one bonus feature! A great trick that seems to make napping even better and more efficient is to drink coffee before taking a nap. Keep the nap time to around 15-20 minutes and you will wake up feeling alert and with truly minimal grogginess! This is because the coffee contains caffeine, which is a stimulant and takes around 20 minutes to kick in. So you can sleep for a short time after drinking the coffee, and when you’re ready to wake up, the coffee is ready to help you be alert! So, to recap, an example of the “ideal nap” would be to take a 15 minute nap at around 2 p.m. in a dark quiet comfortable room just after having drank a bit of coffee. I hope that this discussion of napping has helped all of you new to the sleep community in making an informed an educated decision whether to take naps or not, and how to properly go about napping.

        |Dreams, Dreams, Dreams:
      p Another topic in the sleep community that people have always been fascinated about, and a topic that is still not fully understood to this very day is dreaming. Everyone has dreamt, and almost everyone has recalled dreaming. Dreaming is as close as humans can get to experiencing magic and surreal phenomena. In fact, early on, people used to think dreams were phenomena that were messages from supernatural powers. People also used to think that during sleep, the brain stopped functioning and entered a state of inactivity. The truth is actually the reverse! The brain becomes more active and we see parallel processing states that are not possible during conscious, awake hours, which suggests that the brain is even more active when it is asleep than when it is awake. Dreaming is clear proof of the brain’s activities during sleep, and it is a very important component of sleep, particularly that of REM sleep. REM (Rapid Eye Movement) Sleep was a phase of sleep discovered by a team including sleep researcher Dr. Dement, and it was discovered that during this phase was when the great majority of intense dreams occurred. While we can see for a fact when dreams are occurring by looking at the EEG waves of a sleeping person, it is still a mystery as to what purpose dreams have and what determines what kind of dreams some one will have. Now, most people are familiar with the concept of dreaming, but not many are familiar with the types of dreams and their distinctions. Two of the important distinctions we will explore are nightmares and lucid dreams. The first distinction, nightmares, is relatively common and experienced by most people. A nightmare is any dream that causes a strong emotional mental response. These emotional responses are usually fear, anxiety, or sadness, and can put the dreamer in situations of psychological stress, and physical danger. The dreamer is not aware that the nightmare is just a dream, which makes it all the more real and terrifying for the dreamer. The nightmare usually ends when the user awakens through some external (someone waking you up) or internal (dying in your nightmare) stimulus, usually in distress. There are often feelings of helplessness during these episodes. There has been research into why nightmares occur and while it is nearly impossible to find something conclusive, it is suggested that physical, psychological and chemical stress may play a part in nightmares. Being sick or anxious before bed may increase the odds of having a nightmare, as well as taking painkillers or opiates. It has even been suggested that eating food before bed can trigger nightmares as the brain becomes more active after eating. While most people know about nightmares and know that they are not a pleasant experience to have, most people don’t know about lucid dreaming and its positive experience. Lucid dreaming occurs when a dreamer is aware that they are dreaming. Discovery of this phenomenon has dated all the way back to Ancient Greece, and the term “lucid dreaming” was first coined by psychiatrist Willem van Eeden in the late 1800s. Once someone knows that they are in a dream (therefore they are now officially “lucid dreaming”), then they have a much greater chance and ability to exert free will in participating in the dream. They may be able to manipulate the environment and control themselves and their environment to do anything possible in the dream world, in which literally anything is possible! Dreamers tend to remember more details and vivid imagery when they are lucid dreaming. From a psychophysiological perspective, scientific studies suggest that there are higher amounts of brain waves in the beta-1 frequency (around 13-19 Hertz) during lucid dreaming. This frequency corresponds to brain activity in the parietal lobes, which are usually active during consciousness. Lucid dreaming is a rare occurrence and even though many dreams contain absurdly unrealistic contents, the dreamer is still many times not aware that they are in a dream. Some suggest that mental processes that occur while dreaming inhibit dreamers from evaluating the reality of their dreams. Lucid dreaming, whenever it occurs is generally an enjoyable, calming, and enlightening experience, as the dreamer is able to control themselves and do things otherwise deemed impossible in the real world. However we know that lucid dreaming is rare, so how do we increase our chances of lucid dreaming? Although not conclusive, there are many steps experts have suggested that may increase the possibility of experiencing lucid dreams. One of the most important is to keep a dream diary in which you right down the contents of your dreams immediately after you wait up. This will help your recognize patterns and common dream elements that occur in reality as well. It will also help show you what is unique to your dreams as well that does not occur in reality. We call these “dream signs”, and they will be your mental tell to see if you are dreaming or not. In addition, getting into the habit of doing reality checks (pinching yourself)during your conscious hours will help you to also do reality checks while you are dreaming, which may cue you in to the fact that you are dreaming. There are also a host of sequenced techniques developed to try and increase the chances of lucid dreaming which you should feel free to browse and try as well! Some of these techniques are the Wake Initiate Lucid Dream technique, the Wake Back to Bed technique, and Dream Induced Lucid Dreaming technique. I encourage you to try any and all of these out and see the results for yourself! Lucid dreaming is an amazing experience that too few get to realize, and I hope you will join the ranks of lucid dreamers!
